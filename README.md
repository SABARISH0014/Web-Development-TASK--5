Description:

Build a basic calculator application that can
perform simple arithmetic operations like addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Implementation:

1. Create React components for the calculator interface,
number, and operation buttons.
2. Use React state (useState hook) to manage the
input and output of the calculator.
3. Implement event handlers for button clicks to update
the input and perform calculations.
4. Style the calculator using CSS for a user-friendly
interface.
